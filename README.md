## **Experience**
### Carl Zeiss AG, Full Time Research Intern and Master Thesis Student
#### &emsp; October 2021 – November 2022
- For my Master Thesis:
  - My goal is to digitally stabilise a video feed coming from a camera in real-time.
  - The camera has an oscillating motion and I have to estimate position using an Inertial Measurement Unit.
  - Evaluating various neural network architectures(Resnet, CNN, LSTM, Transformer) for pose-estimation.
  - Process the neural network outputs using signal-processing techniques to smoothen the output.
  - Precision requirements are very high of the order of 0.1 mm.
  - Testing of Neural Network inferences on various edge hardware like Google Edge TPU and Raspberry Pi to determine real-time application possibility for different models.

- During my internship:
  - I evaluated various simulation platforms like Epic Games Unreal Engine, Microsoft AirSim, Isaac Sim SDK and Nvidia Omniverse for camera and IMU sensor simulation.
  - I created simulation environments to mimic the real life situation.
  - Implementation of IMU Noise model from scratch to make the data more realistic and introduce randomness i.e domain randomization.
  - Testing the simulated data against real data. 
  - Trained and Evaluated various Neural Networks (CNNs, RNNs) for motion prediction from IMU data.

### Master Project - SLAM and Path Planning for Follow-Me Function in an Autonomous Delivery Robot
#### &emsp May 2021 - January 2022

- Simulated a world in Gazebo which depicted a real-world like residential neighbourhood.
- Built a Map (2D Occupancy Grid Map and 3D-Octomap) of the Environment using various SLAM Algorithms (gmapping, Hector SLAM and RTAB-Mapping) for comparison and use.
- Implemented a path planning package which helps the Mobile Robot to reach its goals safely and correctly.

## **Projects**
- **Robotics Related Projects**
  - **_Home Service Robot_**: In this project I combined localization, SLAM, and planned robotic algorithms into a home service robot. The goal of this project was to program a robot that can autonomously map an environment and navigate to pick up and drop virtual objects.
  - **_UR5 Robotic Arm_**: Implemented a Sin-Mover and Inverse Kinematics based ROS Nodes in C++ to control the Robotic Arm.
  - **_Franka Robot Arm_**: Implemented an Inverse-Kinematic based arm control in the NVIDIA Omniverse simulated environment.
  - **_Go Chase It_**: Wrote an image processing node in ROS which helps the Robot to follow a white ball in the given environment. 
  - **_Localisation_**: In this project, I learnt to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the 
Gazebo simulation environments. 

- **Deep Learning Related Projects**: Worked on various Deep Learning Related Projects from time to time:
  - Multi-variate Time Series analysis for forecasting.
  - Multi-variate Time Series analysis for classification
  - CNNs for classification
  - Character Level RNN for Lyrics Generation
  - Multi – Timeseries Forecasting
  - Object Recognition on Raspberry Pi

- **Computer Vision Related Projects**: Worked on various small and relatively big projects like:
  - Advanced Lane Line Detection
  - European Bank Notes Classification
  - Video Editing Pipeline
  - Camera Calibration
  - Gradients and Colour Spaces
