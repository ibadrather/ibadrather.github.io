## **Projects**
- **Robotics Related Projects**
  - **_Home Service Robot_**: In this project I combined localization, SLAM, and planned robotic algorithms into a home service robot. The goal of this project was to program a robot that can autonomously map an environment and navigate to pick up and drop virtual objects.
  - **_UR5 Robotic Arm_**: Implemented a Sin-Mover and Inverse Kinematics based ROS Nodes in C++ to control the Robotic Arm.
  - **_Franka Robot Arm_**: Implemented an Inverse-Kinematic based arm control in the NVIDIA Omniverse simulated environment.
  - **_Go Chase It_**: Wrote an image processing node in ROS which helps the Robot to follow a white ball in the given environment. 
  - **_Localisation_**: In this project, I learnt to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the 
Gazebo simulation environments. 

- **Deep Learning Related Projects**: Worked on various Deep Learning Related Projects from time to time:
  - Multi-variate Time Series analysis for forecasting.
  - Multi-variate Time Series analysis for classification
  - CNNs for classification
  - Character Level RNN for Lyrics Generation
  - Multi – Timeseries Forecasting
  - Object Recognition on Raspberry Pi

- **Computer Vision Related Projects**: Worked on various small and relatively big projects like:
  - Advanced Lane Line Detection
